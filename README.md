# Calculator Hub

Hey there! Welcome to **Calculator Hub**, your go-to spot for all kinds of calculations right in your web browser. Whether you're calculating numbers for school, checking your health stats, or figuring out how old you really are, I've got you covered with a collection of easy-to-use calculators.


## Meet the Calculators

I've rounded up three awesome tools to make your life easier:

### Scientific Calculator
Explore into advanced math with functions like sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, square roots, powers, and factorials.

### BMI Calculator
Curious about your Body Mass Index? This calculator lets you input your height and weight in either metric or imperial units. It gives you your BMI score, tells you what category you're in (like normal weight or overweight), and even shows a handy scale to understand the ranges. 

### Age Calculator
Ever wondered exactly how old you are down to the day? Pop in your birthdate, and this calculator will tell you your age in years, months, and days. Plus, it counts down the days until your next birthday. Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, or just satisfying your curiosity.

## Technologies used
- **HTML**: The structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: For that beautiful, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the calculations and interactivity.
